## `Backend Features`
This is the backend for the project [your turn](https://github.com/Quiahn/your-turn). This api controls the user sign up, log in, posts, and username availability.

## `Project Idea`
Your turn is a experimental social media that allows users to draw a number and post for a chance at getting their post shown on the main page. A number 0-1000 is attached to every post, the top 3 users with the highest number get their post featured. The goal is to get users to post daily whether it's to try to start a conversation or to advertise their business.
